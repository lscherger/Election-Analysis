# Election-Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
### Background
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has requested an election audit of a recent local congressional election. The audit should determine the winner of the election by popular vote. The audit should also provide more information about the voting data by calculating the total vote and each candidate's vote count along with their percentage of total votes. In addition, the employee has requested that the analysis break down the voting data by county to determine the county with the largest voter turnout.

### Purpose 
The purpose of this analysis is to deliver the election results efficiently by automating calculations with Python. By using Python, we can analyze a large data set using loops and conditional statements. While this analysis provides the results from this local congressional election, the summary also includes suggestions for modifying this script to be used in the future for any election.
